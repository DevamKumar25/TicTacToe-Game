Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game features both single-player mode, where you can play against the computer, and an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal decision-making.

Features
Player vs Computer: Play as 'O' while the computer plays as 'X'.
Smart AI: The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to always make the best possible move.
Interactive Gameplay: Users can choose their move by selecting from available positions on the board.
Dynamic Game Board: The game board updates after every move and displays the current state.
Result Declaration: At the end of the game, a message declares if it's a win, loss, or draw.
How to Play
Run the Program: Upon running the program, you'll be prompted to choose whether you want to go first or let the computer start.
Choose a Move: The game will display available positions on the board as numbers from 1 to 9. Select a position to place your 'O'.
Winning Conditions: The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board fills up without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
Replay Option: After the game ends, you can choose to replay or exit the game.
